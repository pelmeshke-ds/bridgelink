# bridgelink

BridgeLink is a component that connects input driver controller and host device via UART. This enables HID input (such as buttons, sticks position, gyroscope data) forwarding from controllers to Linux hosts

In pelmeshke-ds BridgeLink is used for communication between Arduino Pro Micro and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
