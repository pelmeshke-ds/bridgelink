# bridgelink

**BridgeLink** is a component that connects input driver controller and host device via UART. This enables HID input (such as buttons, sticks position, gyroscope data) forwarding from controllers to Linux hosts

In **pelmeshke-ds** BridgeLink is used for communication between Arduino Pro Micro (also known as SparkFun Pro Micro with ATmega32U4) and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

## Controller firmware installation


1. Download Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/
2. TODO
The provided code is supposed for use on Arduino Pro Micro (or other HID-compatible Arduino-like controllers)


## Host device daemon installation
